        <h3>My Trip To California</h3>
        <p>
          It was a long, quick trip. We loaded our vehicle and headed to
          Northern California for the 4th of July weekend for a family reunion.
          We then made haste to Magic Mountain. By the time we returned home, we
          had traveled some 1,300 miles in three and one half days.

        <h3>My Trip To The Rockies</h3>
        <p>
          After a year's preparation, it was time to go backpacking with the Boy
          Scouts. We flew to Colorado Springs, toured the Air Force Academy,
          Pike's Peak, Garden Of The Gods, and the Olympic training center. We
          chartered a bus to the Philmont Scout Ranch in Northern New Mexico and
          began our 60 mile backpack trek. Afterwards, we boarded Amtrack's and
          rode the rails to Kingman, and then chartered a bus home.

        <h3>My Trip To The Mid West</h3>
        <p>
          My wife and I drove our son's little red Ford Mustang some 2,900 miles
          to him in Indiana where he attends college. In route, we stopped at
          Nauvoo, Illinois, and Detroit, Michigan. We then boarded Amtrak in
          Chicago, and rode it to Salt Lake City, where we boarded a bus which
          returned us to Las Vegas.
